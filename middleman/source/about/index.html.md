In the cloud era, the application platform will be delivered as a service, often described as Platform as a Service (PaaS). PaaS makes it much easier to deploy, run and scale applications. Some PaaS offerings have limited language and framework support, do not deliver key application services, or restrict deployment to a single cloud. Cloud Foundry is the industry’s Open PaaS and provides a choice of clouds, frameworks and application services. As an open source project, there is a broad community both contributing and supporting Cloud Foundry.

Open cloud and open source are only part of the transformation underway, there is also a massive narrative building around continuous innovation and high velocity agile development. Some open source projects foster inclusiveness and sacrifice velocity while some increase velocity at the expense of transparency. Cloud Foundry.org’s unique vision is to foster contributions from a broad community of developers, users, customers, partners and ISVs while advancing development of the platform at extreme velocity. Cloud Foundry.org exists to provide a platform for the community of customers, partners and even former competitors to collaborate, teach, share and learn together, accelerating the pace of innovation and contribution.  The best way to [get involved](/get-in) is to [join the conversation](https://groups.google.com/a/cloudfoundry.org/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/vcap-dev), contribute to the [wiki](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/cf-docs-contrib/wiki) and [fork the code](https://github.com/cloudfoundry). We call it ‘fierce collaboration’ and we hope you will join us.
